👋 Hey there, I’m [Cale Morris]!
🎯 Purpose-Driven Developer
I'm a Python enthusiast focused on projects that make a difference. I love using tech to solve real-world problems, particularly in the realm of data science and financial markets. Whether it’s deriving insights from abstract data or fine-tuning AI models, I aim to create solutions that matter.

💻 What I’m Working On:
🔎 Financial Sentiment Analysis Program
I'm developing a system that gathers data from multiple sources—both within and outside the finance sector—and processes it using an AI assistant I've trained. The AI identifies patterns and correlations in market sentiment, volatility, and risk, with human checks guiding its analysis. This project aims to give financial market participants a fresh perspective, helping them uncover insights they might otherwise miss.

⚙️ Tech Stack:
Python (because it’s just that versatile!) 🐍
pip for managing packages and libraries
With these, I believe you can build anything!
✨ What I Value:
Beautiful User Interfaces: I’m no graphic designer, but I always aim for a polished final product. 🎨
Open-Source Contribution: I deeply admire the "give a book, take a book" spirit of open-source communities, and I look forward to giving back. 📚
🎵 Hobbies:
I’ve been producing electronic music for over 22 years! 🎧 My journey into programming actually started with computer-based music production. Creativity in both sound and code keeps me driven.

🚀 Future Goals:
I’m currently working on 2-3 commercial projects. While they’re still in the early stages, I’m excited about their potential to make an impact! 💡
